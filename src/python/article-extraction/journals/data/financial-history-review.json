I decompose Virginia's paper money into its expected real-asset present value, risk discount and transaction premium. The value of Virginia's paper money was determined primarily by its real-asset present value. The transaction premium was small. Positive risk discounts occurred in years when monetary troubles were suspected, namely worries that the government would not redeem the paper money as promised. Counterfeiting, however, was not one of these worries. The legislature had the tools and used them effectively to mitigate the effects of counterfeiting on the value of its paper money. Colonial Virginia's paper money was not a fiat currency, but a barter asset, with just enough transaction premium to make it the preferred medium of exchange for local transactions. It functioned like a zero-coupon bond and traded below face value due to time-discounting, not depreciation.", "hyperlink": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/colonial-virginias-paper-money-17551774-value-decomposition-and-performance/14F375610ECB4B85410680AC6161FF5A", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0968565018000057", "email": "grubbf@udel.edu", "authors": "Farley Grubb", "institution": "University of Delaware", "address": "University of Delaware, Economics Department Newark, DE 19716 "}, {"title": "US inflation and inflation uncertainty over 200 years", "corresp": "D.

Despite this willingness to share as little as possible, some archival funds have gradually become available, most notably after businesses went bankrupt, changed hands, or simply disappeared. The present article relies on these sources to analyse the evolution of the Geneva stock exchange during the interwar period, which saw a gradual decline of its activity. Independent brokers strived to keep their oligopoly over banks. At the same time, Swiss German banks tried to penetrate the canton-controlled marketplace by using their federal rights and strength to become unavoidable actors.

Family considerations greatly affected saving decisions, which detracted from the appeal of savings banks. Their emphasis on individual saving was more suitable for those who needed a flexible alternative to use for different saving needs. This flexibility also made it easier for savings banks to meet growing competition and can explain why they continued to attract workers in the twentieth century.

By contrast, historians from the institutional school defend the thesis that inclusive governance led to broader participation in the market for urban credit.

This high stock volatility was generated by a series of discontinuous jumps as news about uncertainty arrived regularly during the 1930s, as shown by applying the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2006) test for jumps in a time-series. To provide a more historical narrative for these jumps, I outline some key events during the Great Depression that generated a sense of uncertainty for businesses and households which occurred contemporaneously to these extreme jumps. While much of the literature has placed Roosevelt's New Deal as a primary source of uncertainty, I do not find much evidence for this hypothesis, and instead find that banking crises, the breakdown of the gold standard, popular unrest and uncertainty related to the brewing war in Europe were primarily responsible for both jumps in returns and the uncertainty of the 1930s.", "hyperlink": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/stock-volatility-return-jumps-and-uncertainty-shocks-during-the-great-depression/9F60B3D95B042CB7B3FB35118E31E7ED", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0968565016000111", "email": "mathy@american.edu", "authors": "Gabriel P.

We examine the ability of the log-periodic power law model (LPPL-model) to accurately predict the end dates of speculative bubbles on financial markets through modeling of asset price dynamics on a selection of historical bubbles. The method is based on a nonlinear least squares estimation that yields predictions of when the bubble will change regime. Previous studies have only presented results where the predictions turn out to be successful. This study is the first to highlight both the potential and the limitations of the LPPL-model. We find evidence that supports the characteristic patterns as proposed by the LPPL-framework leading up to the change in regime; asset prices during bubble periods seem to oscillate around a faster-than-exponential growth. In most cases the estimation yields accurate predictions, although we conclude that the predictions are quite dependent on the point in time at which they are conducted. We also find that the end of a speculative bubble seems to be influenced by both endogenous speculative growth and exogenous factors.

Taking the case of forests in Sweden, this article reviews the ways in which climate-related risks such as storm/wind and fire risks have been assured. The study shows that climate-related risks have generally increased over time and that major hazard events have been decisive for strategy and organisation choices. Twentieth-century developments show that corporate insurance coverage increased due to higher levels of anticipated risk, while self-insurance and public insurance were reduced. However, in more recent times the expansion of corporate insurance has stagnated.

The purpose of this article is to study the 1817 banking crisis from a new perspective by attempting to answer the following research question: why did Malm\u00f6 diskont go under? Institutional theory is used here as a research tool. The assumption is that institutions set the limits for individuals' actions and sometimes direct them towards particular actions. The conclusions are derived from analysing the institutional framework at the time and how it interacted with Malm\u00f6 diskont. The crisis evolved in two stages. The first stage occurred when the financial position of Malm\u00f6 diskont severely deteriorated in the interaction between institutions and actors in 1817. The implementation of a bailout and a new institutional structure would have been necessary to save the bank.

In this period, in Germany, the branch network of banks expanded significantly and at the end of the period almost all economically active individuals had a current account. This change was triggered by rising wages and income. Rising wages increased the burden of weekly wage payments in cash, and rising income made the average earner more attractive for banks. Moreover, regulation and deregulation, by triggering both price and non-price competition, may also have played a role. Technological change was not an independent driver.

A key dynamic of the crisis was that policyholders at an insurance company have a dual role as holders of liabilities and as providers of income. In addition, I establish that government officials believed National Surety to be systemically important, due to the size of its insurance business and because many of its counterparties were societal actors that these officials sought to protect.

Their experience provides valuable lessons for the ongoing reform efforts in the euro area. The analysis reveals that most of the instruments clearing houses used in the joint production of confidence are similar to the ones euro area governments have recently decided upon, such as the establishment of the European Financial Stability Facility. This suggests that the euro area crisis response has followed best private-sector practices of crisis management. However, inherent fragilities of co-insurance mechanisms as well as the long maturity and elusive quality of government debt present a challenge in designing a sustainable solution to the crisis without compromising on the original goal of euro area governance: ensuring sound fiscal policies as a prerequisite for maintaining price stability.

This study analyzes several current issues by looking back at Moody's original intentions for constructing a ratings system. The study analyzes whether Moody intended his ratings to reflect his private information, or rather, to serve some alternative role, as with monitoring conflicts of interests or realizing informational economies of scale. The study uses an ordinal regression approach to evaluate a set of explanatory variables, constructed from both the manual itself and the panic months of 1907, to test the potential information content of Moody's ratings. At the time of Moody's first rating system, the illiquidity of the US Treasury market forced investors to seek alternative \u2018high-quality\u2019 securities. Indeed, Moody rated 38.94 percent of railroad bonds as Aaa, and rated 85.25 percent of railroad bonds as A, Aa or Aaa in his universe of railroad bonds rated. To further test the informational content of Moody's ratings, the study pursues a structural default analysis during the panic year of 1907, which yields results that indicate that the default risk of railroad securities was quite low at the time. These results provide justification for the high overall ratings that Moody assigned to railroad securities, and thus their role as near risk-free securities.

We use a newly created database with state-level fiscal and risk premium data (between 1891 and 1930) to show that Brazilian states with natural endowments that allowed them to export commodities that were in high demand (e.g. rubber and coffee) ended up having higher revenues per capita and lower cost of capital. We also explain that the variation in revenues per capita was both a product of the variation in natural endowments (i.e. the fact that states cannot produce any commodity they want) and a commodity boom that had asymmetric effects among states. These two effects generated variation in revenues per capita at the state level thanks to the extreme form of fiscal decentralisation that the Brazilian government adopted in the constitution of 1891, which gave states the sole right to tax exports. We also run instrumental variable estimates using indices of export prices for each state.

In terms of the quality of firms allowed onto the market, IPO survival rates of the early and late 1920s were shockingly low, just as earlier research has shown.

This article focuses on the crucial role that merchant networks and the personal connections of financial intermediaries continued to play in international troop payments arranged by the English state through the Dutch Republic. Even when the English or Dutch treasuries could find the necessary money to pay and provision the troops in time, getting the money to the military commanders in the field or to their distant suppliers often depended on long and complex credit lines. Short-term loans acquired in making military expenditure \u2013 consisting of unpaid bills to suppliers, payments advanced by officials and officers, and temporary loans contracted by financial intermediaries \u2013 as well as the widespread reliance on commercial credit in the form of bills of exchange as a way to transfer funds effectively formed the life thread of army finance. The ability to finance the military in times of exploding costs and permanent emergencies without defaulting rested not only on the capacity to draw on financial resources at home, but also on the strength of commercial and financial networks abroad. In doing so, closeness to the centres of emerging international financial capitalism seems to have been of greater importance than a specific set of institutional innovations.", "title": "\u2018The whole art of war is reduced to money\u2019: remittances, short-term credit and financial intermediation in Anglo-Dutch military finance, 1688\u20131713", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0968565017000282", "institution": "Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam", "authors": "Pepijn Brandon", "email": "p.brandon@vu.nl", "address": "Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen De Boelelaan 1105 1081 HV Amsterdam "}, {"hyperlink": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/most-difficult-financial-matter-that-has-ever-presented-itself-paper-money-and-the-financing-of-warfare-under-louis-xiv/D7DA295698EBED10F26D9AF18AFA2037", "corresp": "J.

The article shows how concerns about economic activity, coinage and the need to finance the war deficit led to a series of debasements of the French currency, the establishment of a bank in the form of a Caisse des emprunts and the introduction of mint bills, which became legal tender and caused the first experience of fiat money inflation in history. Whereas Chamillart's personal shortcomings have been recently suggested as the cause of Louis XIV's humbling in the War of the Spanish Succession, I argue on the contrary that the introduction of paper money in 1704 was key to the capacity of France to sustain its military effort, but that a succession of military defeats against a more powerful coalition led to inflation. I also argue that the introduction of paper money saved the Caisse des emprunts and its bonds which helped sustain the war effort up until the peace. By situating the use of paper money within the broader question of the exercise of power in the absolute monarchy, this article examines the formation of fiscal policy, paying attention to the ways in which government sought advice from experts.

However, Jiaqing's policy of austerity and retrenchment was not simply an expedient in times of fiscal strain, but deeply rooted in ideological struggles over taxation that began in the eighteenth century. It was an expression of hardline fiscal conservatism, which held fixed revenue quotas sacrosanct and which I call quota-ism.

Contrary to the consensus view in the existing literature, local political and military elites, which most tax farmers and large landowners belonged to, did not play a dominant role as moneylenders.

Following\nthe French Revolution, French law legitimized lending at interest in principle,\nbut punished \u2018habitual usurers\u2019 who \u2018made a\nprofession\u2019 from lending above the legal limit. The decades that followed\nwitnessed striking growth in banking, joint-stock companies and other financial\ninstitutions.

By examining how habitual usury was defined and\nprosecuted in French courtrooms, this article shows how habitual usurers both\nvalidated and undermined stereotypical notions of predatory lending behavior\nfound in popular culture of the time. Habitual usury trials also reveal the\nactual practices that allowed those excluded from formal financial networks to\nparticipate in the growth of capitalist relations.

In seeking to ascertain what led to the success of the informal rural credit market as compared with the formal credit market, the article finds that the local notables, who acted as financial intermediaries for small landholders, enjoyed an information advantage over the banks stemming from the establishment of interlinked credit market transactions connected to the stipulation of bay' waf\u0101, salam and muzara\u2018ah contracts. In a context of land privatisation and growing commercialisation of agriculture, these contracts became the instruments used by notables to invest in peasants' landholdings and to manage a sales network for agricultural products on a local and international scale, hence representing an efficient financial institution to support the \u2018agricultural export-led growth\u2019 of late Ottoman Palestine.", "title": "Informal rural credit markets and interlinked transactions in the district of late Ottoman Haifa, 1890\u20131915", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S096856501400002X", "institution": "Universit\u00e0 di Salerno", "authors": "Stefania Ecchia", "email": null, "address": "Universit\u00e0 di Salerno, "}, {"hyperlink": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/an-anatomy-of-financial-crises-in-norway-18302010/A535D3F4895245425936E823D1BC4DD3", "corresp": "Arngrim Hunnes (corresponding author), School of Business and Law, University of Agder, Gimlemoen 50, N-4604, Kristiansand, Norway, Arngrim.Hunnes@uia.no.", "abstract": "On the basis of a novel dataset, the article investigates the anatomy of financial crises in Norway from 1830 to 2010.

This article provides a Bank-of-England-centred perspective on the development of Irish monetary institutions from the granting of Irish monetary independence in December 1921 to the establishment of the Central Bank of Ireland in 1943. Irrespective of unresolved Anglo-Irish political issues, the Bank of England's Irish policy during this period was based on a strict adherence to Montagu Norman's key central banking principles of co-operation, exclusiveness and political autonomy. This article identifies that the application of these principles survived both the coming to power of Fianna F\u00e1il (Soldiers of Destiny) in Southern Ireland in 1932 and the outbreak of war in 1939. This article also argues that Norman's adherence to a wider internationalist view of monetary relations played an important role in forcing the overwhelmingly Protestant and pro-union Irish commercial banks, headed by the Bank of Ireland, to come to terms with the reality of Irish monetary independence. In this context, Norman's approach to Southern Ireland parallels the transition from Empire to Commonwealth, which began to emerge in the interwar period.", "title": "The Bank of England, Montagu Norman and the internationalisation of Anglo-Irish monetary relations, 1922\u20131943", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0968565013000231", "institution": "University College Cork", "authors": "Eoin Drea", "email": null, "address": "University College Cork, "}, {"hyperlink": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/variation-in-organizational-form-across-lines-of-property-insurance-sweden-19131939/568953820D2AF14A045D958D5A9D56A5", "corresp": "J.

Based on the theoretical arguments whereby the mutual organizational form has a competitive advantage in underwriting homogeneous but unknown risk distribution, while the stock organizational form is more likely to underwrite more volatile and heterogeneous risk categories, we conclude that organizational form has a significant impact on risk taking. Our empirical analysis shows that the risk taking, measured as incurred claims to anticipated losses, was on average lower among mutual insurers. When comparing across lines of insurance, the analysis shows that the mutual form was more successful in keeping down risks in fire and marine, while less so in vehicle and specialized property insurance. Stock companies mitigated the higher risk by ceding more premiums to reinsurers and by diversifying more across different lines of insurance.", "title": "Variation in organizational form across lines of property insurance: Sweden, 1913\u20131939", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0968565014000031", "institution": "Umea University", "authors": "Josef Lilljegren", "email": "josef.lilljegren@ekhist.umu.se", "address": "Umea University, Department of Geography and Economic History SE-90187, Umea "}, {"hyperlink": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/christopher-adolph-bankers-bureaucrats-and-central-bank-politics-the-myth-of-neutrality-cambridge-cambridge-university-press-2013-357-pp-9900-isbn-9781107032613/DB2239B7554229CA845758338B18BE16", "corresp": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Christopher Adolph, Bankers, Bureaucrats, and Central Bank Politics: The Myth of Neutrality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013, 357 pp., $99.00, ISBN 978-1-107-03261-3)", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0968565014000043", "institution": "University of Uppsala", "authors": "Mikael Wendschlag", "email": null, "address": "University of Uppsala, "}, {"hyperlink": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/emmanuel-mourlondruol-a-europe-made-of-money-the-emergence-of-the-european-monetary-system-ithaca-ny-cornell-university-press-2012-viii-359-pp-isbn-9780801450839/C6C22015D9ACDF7A67C54AFB1B995AC2", "corresp": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Emmanuel Mourlon-Druol, A Europe Made of Money: The Emergence of the European Monetary System (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2012, viii\u00a0+\u00a0359 pp., ISBN 978-0-8014-5083-9)", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0968565014000055", "institution": "Catholic University of Louvain", "authors": "Ivo Maes", "email": null, "address": "Catholic University of Louvain, National Bank of Belgium and Robert Triffin Chair "}, {"hyperlink": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/benn-steil-the-battle-of-bretton-woods-john-maynard-keynes-harry-dexter-white-and-the-making-of-a-new-world-order-princeton-princeton-university-press-2013-480-pp-29951995-isbn-9780691149097/3EADE52603A50B68BC05180C86CF4288", "corresp": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Benn Steil, The Battle of Bretton Woods: John Maynard Keynes, Harry Dexter White, and the Making of a New World Order (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013, 480 pp., $29.95/\u00a319.95, ISBN 978-0691-14909-7)", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0968565014000067", "institution": "London School of Economics and Political Science", "authors": "Anna Missiaia", "email": null, "address": "London School of Economics and Political Science, "}]}
