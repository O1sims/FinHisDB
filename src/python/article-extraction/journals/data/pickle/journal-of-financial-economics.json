As lenders, institutional investors routinely receive private information about borrowers. However, most of these investors also trade in public securities. This leads to a controversial question: Do institutional investors use private information acquired in the loan market to trade in public securities? This paper examines the stock trading of institutional investors whose portfolios also hold loans. Using the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of loan amendments, we identify institutional investors with access to private information disclosed during loan amendments. We then look at abnormal returns on subsequent stock trades. We find that institutional participants in loan renegotiations subsequently trade in the stock of the same company and outperform trades by other managers and trades in other stocks by approximately 5.4% in annualized terms.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X10002783"}, {"addresses": ["c", "b", "a"], "title": "Asymmetric information, adverse selection, and the pricing of CMBS", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2011", "coverDate": "2011-05-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.12.002", "volume": "100", "authors": [{"authorName": "Xudong An", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Yongheng Deng", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Stuart A.

Conduit lenders, who originate loans for direct sale into securitization markets, mitigate problems of asymmetric information and adverse selection in loan sales. Our theory provides an explanation for the pricing puzzle observed in CMBS markets, whereby conduit CMBS loans are priced higher than portfolio loans, despite widespread belief that conduit loans are originated at lower quality. Consistent with theoretical predictions of a lemons discount, our empirical analysis of 141 CMBS deals and 16,760 CMBS loans shows that, after controlling for observable determinants of loan pricing, conduit loans enjoyed a 34 basis points pricing advantage over portfolio loans in the CMBS market.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X10002916"}, {"addresses": ["c", "b", "a"], "title": "Media ownership, concentration and corruption in bank lending", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2011", "coverDate": "2011-05-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.12.003", "volume": "100", "authors": [{"authorName": "Joel F.

the empirical relation between spot and forward implied volatility in foreign exchange. We formulate and test the forward volatility unbiasedness hypothesis, which may be viewed as the volatility analogue to the extensively researched hypothesis of unbiasedness in forward exchange rates. Using a new dataset of spot implied volatility quoted on over-the-counter currency options, we compute the forward implied volatility that corresponds to the delivery price of a forward contract on future spot implied volatility. This contract is known as a forward volatility agreement. We find strong evidence that forward implied volatility is a systematically biased predictor that overestimates movements in future spot implied volatility. This bias in forward volatility generates high economic value to an investor exploiting predictability in the returns to volatility speculation and indicates the presence of predictable volatility term premiums in foreign exchange.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11000316"}, {"addresses": ["c", "b", "a"], "title": "Forecasting stock market returns: The sum of the parts is more than the whole", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Miguel A.

The improvement in monitoring quality comes at the significant cost of weaker strategic advising and greater managerial myopia.

The relation is hump-shaped when EG is weak, but is insignificant when EG is strong. The results imply that CEO ownership and EG are substitutes for mitigating agency problems when ownership is low. However, very high levels of share ownership can reduce firm value by entrenching the CEO and discouraging him from taking risk, unless mitigated by strong EG. We identify channels through which CEO ownership affects firm value by examining R&D, which is discretionary and risky. We find CEO ownership similarly exhibits a hump-shaped relation with R&D when EG is weak, but no relation when EG is strong. Our results are robust to endogeneity issues concerning CEO ownership and EG.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11001632"}, {"addresses": ["Hanken School of Economics and Business Administration, P.O.

We find that the non-bankrupt strategic alliance partners, on average, experience a negative stock price reaction around their partner firm's bankruptcy filing announcement. This negative effect is strongest for longer partnerships and those with higher returns at the announcement of the initial alliance formation. Furthermore, horizontal alliance firms in declining industries have lower returns, indicating that industry conditions can exacerbate expected problems for the non-bankrupt firm. Non-bankrupt partners also experience drops in profit margins and investment levels in the subsequent two years with the worst performance concentrated among the longer-term agreements. There is very little impact on the returns or performance for joint venture partners, which suggests that these agreements are more insulating for the partner firm.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11002352"}, {"addresses": ["b", "a"], "title": "Hedge funds as liquidity providers: Evidence from the Lehman bankruptcy", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2012", "coverDate": "2012-03-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.10.004", "volume": "103", "authors": [{"authorName": "George O.

We also examine factors that influence the relation between ownership structure and syndicate structure, including lead arranger reputation, prior lending relationship, borrowing firm informational opacity, presence of multiple large owners, laws and institutions, and financial crises.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11002388"}, {"addresses": ["b", "a"], "title": "The flight home effect: Evidence from the syndicated loan market during financial crises", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Mariassunta Giannetti", "email": "mariassunta.giannetti@hhs.se"}, {"authorName": "Luc Laeven", "email": "LLaeven@imf.org"}], "coverDate": "2012-04-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.12.006", "volume": "104", "year": "2012", "issue": "1", "abstract": null, "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11002820"}, {"addresses": ["b", "a"], "title": "Internal corporate governance, CEO turnover, and earnings management", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Sonali Hazarika", "email": "sonali.hazarika@baruch.cuny.edu"}, {"authorName": "Jonathan M.

During the last quarter of the 20th century, some community banks reduced their traditional reliance on correspondent banks for upstream products and services by joining bankers' banks, a form of business cooperative. Research on vertical integration focuses primarily on firm-specific investment, market power, and government regulation. However, this case is difficult to explain in terms of these standard vertical integration motives. Our evidence suggests that bankers' banks are a response to technological change and deregulation that results in increased costs faced by community banks in dealing with correspondent banks as both suppliers and potential competitors. For instance, loan participations require sharing proprietary information about major loan customers, something a community bank would not want to provide to a potential competitor.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X1100198X"}, {"addresses": ["b", "a"], "title": "Payout yield, risk, and mispricing: A Bayesian analysis", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2012", "coverDate": "2012-07-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.12.002", "volume": "105", "authors": [{"authorName": "Jay Shanken", "email": "jay_shanken@bus.emory.edu"}, {"authorName": "Ane Tamayo", "email": "A.M.Tamayo@lse.ac.uk"}], "issue": "1", "abstract": null, "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11002650"}, {"addresses": ["b", "a"], "title": "Predicting fraud by investment managers", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2012", "coverDate": "2012-07-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2012.01.002", "volume": "105", "authors": [{"authorName": "Stephen G.

We employ two different data sets that identify loan holdings for a large set of CLOs and find that adverse selection problems in corporate loan securitizations are less severe than commonly believed. Using a battery of performance tests, we find that loans securitized before 2005 performed no worse than comparable unsecuritized loans originated by the same bank. Even loans originated by the bank that acts as the CLO underwriter do not show under-performance relative to the rest of the CLO portfolio. While some evidence exists of under-performance for securitized loans originated between 2005 and 2007, it is not consistent across samples, performance measures, and horizons. Overall, we argue that the securitization of corporate loans is fundamentally different from securitization of other assets classes because securitized loans are fractions of syndicated loans. Therefore, mechanisms used to align incentives in a lending syndicate are likely to reduce adverse selection in the choice of CLO collateral.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X12000773"}, {"addresses": ["d", "c", "b", "a"], "title": "Systematic risk and the cross section of hedge fund returns", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Turan G.

We document that commercial banks set up conduits to securitize assets worth $1.3 trillion while insuring the newly securitized assets using explicit guarantees. We show that regulatory arbitrage was an important motive behind setting up conduits. In particular, the guarantees were structured so as to reduce regulatory capital requirements, more so by banks with less capital, and while still providing recourse to bank balance sheets for outside investors. Consistent with such recourse, we find that conduits provided little risk transfer during the run, as losses from conduits remained with banks instead of outside investors and banks with more exposure to conduits had lower stock returns.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X12001894"}, {"addresses": ["c", "b", "a"], "title": "The \u201cout-of-sample\u201d performance of long run risk models", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2013", "coverDate": "2013-03-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2012.09.006", "volume": "107", "authors": [{"authorName": "Wayne Ferson", "email": "ferson@marshall.usc.edu"}, {"authorName": "Suresh Nallareddy", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Biqin Xie", "email": null}], "issue": "3", "abstract": null, "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X12001912"}, {"addresses": ["Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States"], "title": "Inventory investment and the cost of capital", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2013", "coverDate": "2013-03-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2012.09.001", "volume": "107", "authors": [{"authorName": "Christopher S.

We show that hard-to-borrow stocks will have distinct return patterns, responding more to shocks in the supply of shares available, and to changes in the heterogeneity of investor beliefs, than other stocks. We conduct two empirical tests in which we find strong support for these equilibrium predictions. In our first test, we take advantage of a tax-driven exogenous shock to share loan supply and find that when supply is reduced around dividend record dates, prices of hard-to-borrow stocks increase 1.1% while prices of easy-to-borrow stocks are unaffected. In our second test, we find that hard-to-borrow stocks have 4.8% lower three-month returns than other stocks, with negative returns concentrated in stocks with high heterogeneity in investor beliefs. Thus, we extend the Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002) result that stocks with a greater dispersion of investor beliefs have lower returns.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X12002528"}, {"addresses": ["c", "b", "a"], "title": "Learning and the disappearing association between governance and returns", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2013", "coverDate": "2013-05-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2012.10.004", "volume": "108", "authors": [{"authorName": "Lucian A.

Our evidence also indicates that predictability can be traced to the long legs of the carry trades and their currency components.

The treatment effect is amplified if the acquiring conglomerate operates a more active internal capital market and is largely driven by inventors becoming less productive after the merger rather than inventor exits.

We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997\u20132006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk could, therefore, be undermined by the actions of market participants.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X14002098"}, {"addresses": ["Pennsylvania State University, USA", "University of Michigan, USA"], "title": "Can managers time the market?

To better understand this effect we develop an asset pricing model in which firms in different countries are connected by trade credit links. The model offers further predictions about this phenomenon, including stronger predictability during periods of high credit constraints and low uninformed trading volume.

Specifically, we investigate the effect of societal trust on investor reactions to corporate earnings announcements. We test two competing hypotheses. On the one hand, corporate earnings announcements are perceived as more credible by investors in more trusting societies and, therefore, elicit stronger investor reactions. On the other hand, societal trust mitigates outside investors' concern of moral hazard and reduces the value of corporate earnings announcements to them, thereby weakening their reactions to these events. We analyze the abnormal trading volume and abnormal stock return variance during the earnings announcement period in a large sample of firm-year observations across 25 countries, and we find that both measures of investor reactions to earnings announcements are significantly higher in more trusting countries. We also find that the positive effect of societal trust on investor reactions to earnings news is more pronounced when a country's investor protection and disclosure requirements are weaker, suggesting that trust acts as a substitute for formal institutions; when a country's average education level is lower, consistent with less educated people relying more on trust in making economic decisions; and when firm-level information asymmetry is higher, supporting the notion that trust plays a more important role in poorer information environments.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X13002055"}, {"addresses": ["National Bureau of Economic Research, United States", "University of Chicago Booth School of Business, United States"], "title": "Deflating profitability", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Ray Ball", "email": "Ray.Ball@ChicagoBooth.edu"}, {"authorName": "Joseph Gerakos", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Juhani T.

Based on these two roles, we develop testable hypotheses relating lead IPO underwriter centrality to the IPO characteristics of firms they take public. We find that more central lead IPO underwriters are associated with larger absolute values of offer price revisions, greater IPO and after-market valuations, larger IPO initial returns, greater institutional investor equity holdings and analyst coverage immediately post-IPO, greater stock liquidity post-IPO, and better long-run stock returns.

We also find that a positive relation exists between CSR and value and that CSR attenuates the negative relation between managerial entrenchment and value.", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X16301519"}, {"addresses": ["University of Florida, Warrington College of Business, Box 117168, Gainesville FL 32611, USA", "Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Road, Singapore 178899, Singapore", "University of Central Florida, College of Business, Box 161400, Orlando FL 32816, USA\n"], "title": "Limited attention, marital events and hedge funds", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Yan Lu", "email": "yan.lu@ucf.edu"}, {"authorName": "Sugata Ray", "email": "sugata.ray@ufl.edu"}, {"authorName": "Melvyn Teo", "email": "melvynteo@smu.edu.sg"}], "coverDate": "2016-12-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2016.09.004", "volume": "122", "year": "2016", "issue": "3", "abstract": "We explore the impact of limited attention by analyzing the performance of hedge fund managers who are distracted by marital events.

Further, other forms of CEO compensation did not adjust to offset the dramatic growth in the value of option pay. Number-rigidity in options can also explain the increased dispersion in pay, the difference in growth between the US and other countries, and the increased correlation between pay and firm-specific equity returns. We present evidence that number-rigidity arose from a lack of sophistication about option valuation that is akin to money illusion.

Second, within our framework the dimension of the unrestricted model is the same for the AR(1) as it is for the richer models, and does not expand in line with the state vector as it does in a yield or log price framework. This makes it appropriate to test all of these risk neutral dynamic specifications against the same OLS unrestricted alternative.

Our results provide strong evidence that execution quality differences remain pervasive in corporate bond trading."}, {"addresses": ["Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom", "Tilburg University, PO Box 90153, 5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands", "Center for Economic Policy Research, 33 Great Sutton Street, London EC1V 0DX, United Kingdom", "World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington, DC 20433, United States"], "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Deniz Anginer", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Asli Demirguc-Kunt", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Harry Huizinga", "email": "Huizinga@uvt.nl"}, {"authorName": "Kebin Ma", "email": null}], "coverDate": "2018-11-01", "volume": "130", "year": "2018", "title": "Corporate governance of banks and financial stability", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X18301715", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.06.011", "issue": "2", "abstract": "We find that shareholder-friendly corporate governance is associated with higher stand-alone and systemic risk in the banking sector. Specifically, shareholder-friendly corporate governance results in higher risk for larger banks and for banks that are located in countries with generous financial safety nets as banks try to shift risk toward taxpayers. We confirm our findings by comparing banks to nonfinancial firms and examining changes in bank risk around an exogenous regulatory change in governance. Our results underline the importance of the financial safety net and too-big-to-fail guarantees in thinking about corporate governance reforms at banks."}, {"addresses": ["Department of Economics, University of Toronto, 150 St. George St., Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada", "University of Toronto Mississauga and Rotman School of Management, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, M5S 3E6, Canada", "UNSW Business School, UNSW Business School Building, NSW 2052, Australia"], "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Carole Comerton-Forde", "email": "c.comerton-forde@unsw.edu.au"}, {"authorName": "Katya Malinova", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Andreas Park", "email": null}], "coverDate": "2018-11-01", "volume": "130", "year": "2018", "title": "Regulating dark trading: Order flow segmentation and market quality", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X18301788", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.07.002", "issue": "2", "abstract": "We examine the impact of a rule in the Canadian equities market that requires dark orders to offer price improvement over displayed orders. We show that this rule eliminated intermediation of retail orders in the dark and shifted retail orders onto the lit market with the lowest trading fee. Intermediaries shifted liquidity supply to this market leading to increased displayed liquidity. We conclude that reducing retail order segmentation enhances lit liquidity. Despite the improvement in liquidity, retail traders receive less price improvement. Retail brokers pay higher trading fees to exchanges, and high-frequency traders earn higher revenues from trading fees."}, {"addresses": ["HEC, Paris and CEPR, 1 Rue de la Lib\u00e9ration, 78351 Jouy en Josas, France", "Luxembourg School of Finance, University of Luxembourg, Campus Kirchberg (Bloc F), 6 rue Coudenhove-Kalergi L-1359, Luxembourg"], "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Dugast", "email": "jerome.dugast@uni.lu"}, {"authorName": "Thierry Foucault", "email": "foucault@hec.fr"}], "coverDate": "2018-11-01", "volume": "130", "year": "2018", "title": "Data abundance and asset price informativeness", "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X18301806", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.07.004", "issue": "2", "abstract": "Information processing filters out the noise in data but it takes time. Hence, low precision signals are available before high precision signals. We analyze how this feature affects asset price informativeness when investors can acquire signals of increasing precision over time about the payoff of an asset. As the cost of low precision signals declines, prices are more likely to reflect these signals before more precise signals become available. This effect can ultimately reduce price informativeness because it reduces the demand for more precise signals (e.g., fundamental analysis).

The traits have a monotonic and close to linear relation with CEO pay, but their correlations with pay, firm size, and CEO fixed effects in firm policies are relatively low.

We find causal evidence that regulators delay interventions before elections. The extent of the delay is larger for elected regulators than regulators appointed by the governor. Interventions by appointed regulators are less likely before competitive gubernatorial elections. Regulatory governance mechanisms that constrain the discretion of regulators reduce the delays of appointed regulators but not elected. Finally, we find evidence that suggests electoral delays increase the ultimate costs of failure."}, {"addresses": ["Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University and NBER, 79 JFK Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA", "Department of Banking and Finance, University of Zurich, Plattenstrasse 14, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland", "Department of Banking and Finance, University of Zurich, Swiss Finance Institute, CEPR, and ECGI, Plattenstrasse 14, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland"], "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "authors": [{"authorName": "Alexander F.

High-tax firms and those with large deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) gained; those with significant deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards (NOL DTAs) lost. Domestically focused companies fared better than internationally oriented firms. A price contribution analysis shows that easily assessed consequences (DTLs, NOL DTAs, tax rates) were priced faster than more complex issues (net DTLs, foreign exposure). In sum, the analysis demonstrates that expectations about tax rates greatly impact firm values."}]
