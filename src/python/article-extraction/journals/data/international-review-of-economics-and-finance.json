Contrary to existing results indicating the strong role for expectations in Chinese monetary policy, we find expectations only play a significant role after year 2008, before which there is little role for expectations. This finding is robust to whether the expectations series used relates to individual consumers or professional forecasters. We also find that the Chinese central bank promotes economic growth in a pro-cyclical way whereas it holds a countercyclical policy for inflation.", "address": ["School of Finance, Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, China", "China Financial Policy Research Center, School of Finance, Renmin University of China, China"], "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059056018301412"}, {"title": "Do short-term international capital movements play a role in exchange rate and stock price transmission mechanism in China?", "journal": "International Review of Economics & Finance", "year": "2018", "coverDate": "2018-09-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.iref.2018.02.010", "institutions": ["d", "c", "b", "a"], "volume": "57", "authors": [{"authorName": "Xin Li", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Chi-Wei Su", "email": "cwsu7137@gmail.com"}, {"authorName": "Hsu-Ling Chang", "email": null}, {"authorName": "Ji Ma", "email": null}], "issue": null, "abstract": "This paper applies wavelet analysis to investigate the role of short-run international capital movements (SICM) in the interaction mechanism between the exchange rate and stock prices (SP).

A DCC-GARCH model and a dynamic conditional variance decomposition method are applied to the local currency weekly government bond yields of eight East Asian markets over the period January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2012. We find low levels of integration between the local bond markets in the ASEAN4 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand) and the external markets in terms of both dynamic conditional correlations and dynamic conditional variance decompositions. There has been no upward trend in these two measures of integration for emerging East Asian countries. However, Hong Kong and Singapore are highly integrated with the external markets. In particular, they are more integrated with the US market than with the intraregional cross-border bond markets.

While the background risk is neither hedgeable nor insurable, the firm has access to fairly priced futures and option contracts to hedge against the price risk. We show that the separation theorem holds in that the firm's optimal output level depends neither on the risk attitude of the firm nor on the incident to the underlying uncertainty. However, hedging does not always enhance production. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the full-hedging theorem holds and thus options are not used. When these conditions are violated, we show that the firm optimally uses options to better cope with the complicated state-dependence structure between risk and preferences, thereby rendering options a hedging role over and above that of futures.", "address": ["School of Economics and Finance, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong"], "hyperlink": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059056017305427"}, {"title": "Production fragmentation and factor price convergence", "journal": "International Review of Economics & Finance", "authors": [{"authorName": "H\u00fclya Sayg\u0131l\u0131", "email": "hulya.saygili@tcmb.gov.tr"}], "coverDate": "2017-09-01", "doiUrl": "10.1016/j.iref.2017.07.022", "volume": "51", "year": "2017", "issue": null, "abstract": "In this analysis, we empirically analyze if the nature of trade matters for international factor price convergence.

These results, robust in a variety of settings, indicate that VMA rule signals have steadily lost their ability to forecast future price movements accurately.

Both alternatives have the same constraint of the status-quo i.e. at least half of the citizens must be satisfied with the agreement so that ruling party can ensure that it can be re-elected under the pair wise voting rule.

Later, we drop the status quo constraint from the cooperative agreement and find that (a) under symmetric benefit case (i.e. where both countries have the same level of benefit from a public good), the non-cooperative agreement is weakly dominant over the cooperative agreement in terms of welfare; and (b) under the asymmetric benefit case the complete cooperation is not possible. Finally, we show that, under certain conditions, the welfare of the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) is equivalent to the welfare of non-cooperative agreement with the status-quo.
